# Changelog

## 0.1.3 (Upcoming)

### New Features

* `tetra::error::Result` and `tetra::error::TetraError` are now re-exported in the root of the crate. This allows you to write `tetra::Result` in your function signatures, which aligns a bit better with other custom `Result` types like `io::Result` ([#18](https://github.com/17cupsofcoffee/tetra/issues/18)).
* [An example of how to use the `Animation` type has been added](https://github.com/17cupsofcoffee/tetra/blob/master/examples/animation.rs)  ([#16](https://github.com/17cupsofcoffee/tetra/issues/16)).


## 0.1.2 (December 3, 2018)

### Bug Fixes

* Quick fix to the docs for the mouse button methods.

    * `input::is_mouse_button_released`

### Bug Fixes

* Scaling is now applied relative to the origin ([#12](https://github.com/17cupsofcoffee/tetra/issues/12)).
